    "### About dataset\n",
    "- The dataset is provided in CSV and Pickle formats for ease of use.\n",
    "- Each thread contains multiple emails, allowing for analysis of conversation flow and decision-making processes.\n",
    "- Human-generated summaries enable quick understanding and validation of thread content.\n",
    "- Suitable for tasks such as search, summarization, and retrieval-augmented generation in enterprise settings.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Overview:**  \n",
    "The Email Thread Dataset consists of two main files: `email_thread_details` and `email_thread_summaries`. These files collectively offer a comprehensive compilation of email thread information alongside human-generated summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Email Thread Details**  \n",
    "*Description:*  \n",
    "The `email_thread_details` file provides a detailed perspective on individual email threads, encompassing crucial information such as subject, timestamp, sender, recipients, and the content of the email.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Columns:*\n",
    "- `thread_id`: A unique identifier for each email thread.\n",
    "- `subject`: Subject of the email thread.\n",
    "- `timestamp`: Timestamp indicating when the message was sent.\n",
    "- `from`: Sender of the email.\n",
    "- `to`: List of recipients of the email.\n",
    "- `body`: Content of the email message.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Additional Information:*  \n",
    "The \"to\" column is available in both CSV and Pickle (pkl) formats, facilitating convenient access to recipient information as a column of lists of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Email Thread Summaries**  \n",
    "*Description:*  \n",
    "The `email_thread_summaries` file contains concise summaries crafted by human annotators for each email thread, offering a high-level overview of the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Columns:*\n",
    "- `thread_id`: A unique identifier for each email thread.\n",
    "- `summary`: A concise summary of the email thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Structure:**  \n",
    "The dataset is organized into threads and emails. There are a total of 4,167 threads and 21,684 emails, providing a rich source of information for analysis and research purposes.\n",
