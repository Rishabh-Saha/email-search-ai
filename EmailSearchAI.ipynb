    "### About dataset\n",
    "- The dataset is provided in CSV and Pickle formats for ease of use.\n",
    "- Each thread contains multiple emails, allowing for analysis of conversation flow and decision-making processes.\n",
    "- Human-generated summaries enable quick understanding and validation of thread content.\n",
    "- Suitable for tasks such as search, summarization, and retrieval-augmented generation in enterprise settings.\n",

    "**Email Thread Summary Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:**  \n",
    "The Email Thread Dataset consists of two main files: `email_thread_details` and `email_thread_summaries`. These files collectively offer a comprehensive compilation of email thread information alongside human-generated summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Email Thread Details**  \n",
    "*Description:*  \n",
    "The `email_thread_details` file provides a detailed perspective on individual email threads, encompassing crucial information such as subject, timestamp, sender, recipients, and the content of the email.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Columns:*\n",
    "- `thread_id`: A unique identifier for each email thread.\n",
    "- `subject`: Subject of the email thread.\n",
    "- `timestamp`: Timestamp indicating when the message was sent.\n",
    "- `from`: Sender of the email.\n",
    "- `to`: List of recipients of the email.\n",
    "- `body`: Content of the email message.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Additional Information:*  \n",
    "The \"to\" column is available in both CSV and Pickle (pkl) formats, facilitating convenient access to recipient information as a column of lists of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Email Thread Summaries**  \n",
    "*Description:*  \n",
    "The `email_thread_summaries` file contains concise summaries crafted by human annotators for each email thread, offering a high-level overview of the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Columns:*\n",
    "- `thread_id`: A unique identifier for each email thread.\n",
    "- `summary`: A concise summary of the email thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Structure:**  \n",
    "The dataset is organized into threads and emails. There are a total of 4,167 threads and 21,684 emails, providing a rich source of information for analysis and research purposes.\n",

Stephanie Panus is the primary sender providing the updated Daily Lists and Master Termination Logs covering January through May 2002. Notable updates include marking certain terminations as valid and the inclusion of prepetition mutual terminations. Kim Theriot requests the removal of her own and Melissa Murphy’s names from the distribution list and adds several new recipients. In May, Ed McMichael Jr. forwards a request to colleagues to investigate the CNG LDC (Hope Gas) termination and a related $66 million settlement offer listed in the logs. Multiple Enron personnel are either recipients or mentioned in these communications, reflecting the broad organizational reach of the terminated contracts tracking process.   \n",

Stephanie Panus is the primary sender providing the updated Daily Lists and Master Termination Logs covering January through May 2002. Notable updates include marking certain terminations as valid and the inclusion of prepetition mutual terminations. Kim Theriot requests the removal of her own and Melissa Murphy’s names from the distribution list and adds several new recipients. In May, Ed McMichael Jr. forwards a request to colleagues to investigate the CNG LDC (Hope Gas) termination and a related $66 million settlement offer listed in the logs. Multiple Enron personnel are either recipients or mentioned in these communications, reflecting the broad organizational reach of the terminated contracts tracking process.   \n",

Carol coordinates the attendee list and communication, asking Suzanne to ensure all credit group members, specifically Cathy Tudon and Nidia Martinez, are included, as they were missed previously. John informs Carol about three new group members (Ed Sacks, Brad Schneider, Wendy LeBrocq). Suzanne sends out the invitation and manages RSVPs, while various recipients confirm or decline attendance. There is also some discussion about scheduling a subsequent meeting for May 12th.   \n",

       "4  The email thread centers on reviewing and finalizing the long form confirm/MDEA agreement (including the ILA). Kay Mann suggests distributing the draft agreement internally and to the involved cities with the caveat that it is still under review. Reagan Rorschach asks if certain issues have been incorporated into the draft and lists several specific concerns, such as liquidated damages, payment terms in light of board meeting schedules, venue for arbitration, and applicability of Mississippi law. Edward Sacks comments on the invoicing timeline and raises the possibility of structuring the deal as either a covenant of financial support or as MDEA acting as agent, suggesting that the latter may offer stronger fallback protection for municipalities. Kay indicates that many issues still require fixing, that the draft is not yet fully revised, and that the agent structure’s merits will need further legal review. Ultimately, the group concludes that some of the raised issues are not material for the ILA, and next steps should focus on finalizing and distributing the draft while legal questions are considered further.   \n",

James Saunders and team discuss that while it is possible to separate components for legal entity-only reporting, it is more labor-intensive. The consensus among the team is to keep the process straightforward and to redo the financials only as a last resort if explaining isn't enough.   \n",

There is also a brief mention of mailing 'stuff' and confirming receipt of a check, but golf logistics are the main focus. Plans to play are ultimately canceled due to scheduling complications.  \n",
