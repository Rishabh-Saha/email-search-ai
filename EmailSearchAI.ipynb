    "### About dataset\n",
    "- The dataset is provided in CSV and Pickle formats for ease of use.\n",
    "- Each thread contains multiple emails, allowing for analysis of conversation flow and decision-making processes.\n",
    "- Human-generated summaries enable quick understanding and validation of thread content.\n",
    "- Suitable for tasks such as search, summarization, and retrieval-augmented generation in enterprise settings.\n",

    "**Email Thread Summary Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:**  \n",
    "The Email Thread Dataset consists of two main files: `email_thread_details` and `email_thread_summaries`. These files collectively offer a comprehensive compilation of email thread information alongside human-generated summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Email Thread Details**  \n",
    "*Description:*  \n",
    "The `email_thread_details` file provides a detailed perspective on individual email threads, encompassing crucial information such as subject, timestamp, sender, recipients, and the content of the email.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Columns:*\n",
    "- `thread_id`: A unique identifier for each email thread.\n",
    "- `subject`: Subject of the email thread.\n",
    "- `timestamp`: Timestamp indicating when the message was sent.\n",
    "- `from`: Sender of the email.\n",
    "- `to`: List of recipients of the email.\n",
    "- `body`: Content of the email message.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Additional Information:*  \n",
    "The \"to\" column is available in both CSV and Pickle (pkl) formats, facilitating convenient access to recipient information as a column of lists of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Email Thread Summaries**  \n",
    "*Description:*  \n",
    "The `email_thread_summaries` file contains concise summaries crafted by human annotators for each email thread, offering a high-level overview of the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Columns:*\n",
    "- `thread_id`: A unique identifier for each email thread.\n",
    "- `summary`: A concise summary of the email thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Structure:**  \n",
    "The dataset is organized into threads and emails. There are a total of 4,167 threads and 21,684 emails, providing a rich source of information for analysis and research purposes.\n",

       "4  The email thread revolves around the review and distribution of a 'long form confirm/MDEA' agreement draft. Kay Mann suggests distributing the draft internally and to the relevant cities, while noting that the document requires further revision due to formatting and substantive issues. Reagan Rorschach asks if the draft should be sent to Marvin and enumerates several points likely to raise questions, including liquidated damages, payment terms, legal compliance (Mississippi law), and dispute resolution venue. Edward Sacks provides comments on invoicing timing and the potential structure of the agreement (either as a covenant of financial support or as an 'agent for' arrangement), suggesting further legal analysis for the long-term structure. A follow-up reveals that some issues have not yet been incorporated into the ILA, but Kay indicates they are not material to the current version. The group continues to clarify what changes are substantive and which are formatting or non-material.   \n",

Jeff Dasovich starts by proposing a game since Prentice and Nancy will be together in Napa, suggesting Saturday or Sunday. Scott Laughlin considers the idea and offers Saturday afternoon (after his mandolin lesson) or Sunday as possible times, but notes he and Cameron are undecided. Nancy Sellers points out that Eldon can't play at the preferred course due to concert commitments, but notes there are other courses available. In the end, due to conflicting schedules and repeated out-of-town weekends, Scott and Cameron decide not to join, with Jeff and Eldon possibly pursuing a Sunday game. The conversation also briefly mentions a check and mailing 'stuff,' but these are tangential to the main discussion about golf.   \n",

Jeff initiates the conversation, suggesting golf on either Saturday or Sunday. Scott and Cameron are interested but have scheduling conflicts, with Scott preferring Saturday afternoon after his mandolin lesson and mentioning other commitments on Sunday. Nancy points out that Eldon has rehearsals both days so their usual course isn't available, but suggests alternative courses like Silverado or Kennedy. Eventually, Scott and Cameron decide not to join due to their busy schedules. The group coordinates on potential tee times, with Eldon checking availability. There is also some off-topic mention of mailing items and a check being received.  \n",

The conversation also features casual banter among the group, referencing shared acquaintances and joking about finances. Ben shares news about his personal life, upcoming NYC Marathon plans, travels, and potential job offers, expressing interest in staying connected.  \n",
       "2  The email thread centers around the drafting and review of the 'long form confirm/MDEA' and related ILA documents. Kay Mann initiates internal distribution for feedback and notes pending formatting and content issues, recommending that recipients recognize the drafts as works in progress. Edward Sacks provides comments, particularly questioning whether a financial support covenant or an 'agent for' structure is stronger, and raises invoicing procedure points. Reagan Rorschach forwards documents to a wider internal group, soliciting comments for Kay. Reagan also asks Kay if raised issues have been incorporated into the ILA and whether they are material, to which Kay responds that the issues have not been incorporated and are not material to the ILA. There is ongoing discussion about addressing legal and structural questions, with several parties, including those dealing with Mississippi law, needing to weigh in.  \n",

The emails include questions about the recipient's current location, curiosity about the date of an important upcoming event referred to as a \"big day,\" surprise about the recipient having a girlfriend with a humorous comment about whether she shaves her legs, and a one-word message, 'dirty!!!!!', that seems to be an inside joke or playful tease.
