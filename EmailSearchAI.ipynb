    "### About dataset\n",
    "- The dataset is provided in CSV and Pickle formats for ease of use.\n",
    "- Each thread contains multiple emails, allowing for analysis of conversation flow and decision-making processes.\n",
    "- Human-generated summaries enable quick understanding and validation of thread content.\n",
    "- Suitable for tasks such as search, summarization, and retrieval-augmented generation in enterprise settings.\n",

    "**Email Thread Summary Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:**  \n",
    "The Email Thread Dataset consists of two main files: `email_thread_details` and `email_thread_summaries`. These files collectively offer a comprehensive compilation of email thread information alongside human-generated summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Email Thread Details**  \n",
    "*Description:*  \n",
    "The `email_thread_details` file provides a detailed perspective on individual email threads, encompassing crucial information such as subject, timestamp, sender, recipients, and the content of the email.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Columns:*\n",
    "- `thread_id`: A unique identifier for each email thread.\n",
    "- `subject`: Subject of the email thread.\n",
    "- `timestamp`: Timestamp indicating when the message was sent.\n",
    "- `from`: Sender of the email.\n",
    "- `to`: List of recipients of the email.\n",
    "- `body`: Content of the email message.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Additional Information:*  \n",
    "The \"to\" column is available in both CSV and Pickle (pkl) formats, facilitating convenient access to recipient information as a column of lists of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Email Thread Summaries**  \n",
    "*Description:*  \n",
    "The `email_thread_summaries` file contains concise summaries crafted by human annotators for each email thread, offering a high-level overview of the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Columns:*\n",
    "- `thread_id`: A unique identifier for each email thread.\n",
    "- `summary`: A concise summary of the email thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Structure:**  \n",
    "The dataset is organized into threads and emails. There are a total of 4,167 threads and 21,684 emails, providing a rich source of information for analysis and research purposes.\n",

       "0  The email thread centers on the distribution, updates, and maintenance of the Master Termination Log, which tracks contractual terminations at Enron. Stephanie Panus regularly circulates updated versions of the log and the associated daily termination lists to a wide internal distribution list. Updates include status changes on specific terminations, such as valid terminations for several counterparties and the identification of prepetition mutual terminations. Kim Theriot requests changes to the distribution list to remove herself and Melissa Murphy, and to add additional team members. Later in the thread, Ed McMichael Jr. asks colleagues to investigate a specific termination (CNG LDC/Hope Gas) and a $66 million settlement offer identified in the logs.   \n",

Stephanie Panus regularly circulates updated versions of the log and the associated daily termination lists to a wide internal distribution list. Updates include status changes on specific terminations, such as valid terminations for several counterparties and the identification of prepetition mutual terminations. Kim Theriot requests changes to the distribution list to remove herself and Melissa Murphy, and to add additional team members. Later in the thread, Ed McMichael Jr. asks colleagues to investigate a specific termination (CNG LDC/Hope Gas) and a $66 million settlement offer identified in the logs.   \n",

       "4  The email thread centers around the drafting and review of the 'long form confirm/MDEA' and related ILA documents. Kay Mann initiates internal distribution for feedback and notes pending formatting and content issues, recommending that recipients recognize the drafts as works in progress. Edward Sacks provides comments, particularly questioning whether a financial support covenant or an 'agent for' structure is stronger, and raises invoicing procedure points. Reagan Rorschach forwards documents to a wider internal group, soliciting comments for Kay. Reagan also asks Kay if raised issues have been incorporated into the ILA and whether they are material, to which Kay responds that the issues have not been incorporated and are not material to the ILA. There is ongoing discussion about addressing legal and structural questions, with several parties, including those dealing with Mississippi law, needing to weigh in.   \n",

Nancy points out that Eldon has rehearsals both days so their usual course isn't available, but suggests alternative courses like Silverado or Kennedy. Eventually, Scott and Cameron decide not to join due to their busy schedules. The group coordinates on potential tee times, with Eldon checking availability.

The main discussion is whether to explain the effects of these investments using supporting statements, which is relatively straightforward, or to redo the financial statements to exclude non-NNG items entirely, which would be more labor-intensive. Rod Hayslett recommends explaining impacts as the preferred approach unless absolutely necessary to redo the statements. The team agrees not to complicate the process unnecessarily.   \n",

Carol and Sara are coordinating, with Carol asking Suzanne to send invitations and ensure all necessary individuals are included, notably checking on Cathy Tudon and Nidia Martinez. John Suttle notifies Carol about three new members to be added. Participants are asked to confirm attendance for catering. There is brief mention of a different meeting date by Kaye Ellis and approval from Carol.  \n",

Jeff initiates the conversation, suggesting golf on either Saturday or Sunday. Scott and Cameron are interested but have scheduling conflicts, with Scott preferring Saturday afternoon after his mandolin lesson and mentioning other commitments on Sunday. Nancy points out that Eldon has rehearsals both days so their usual course isn't available, but suggests alternative courses like Silverado or Kennedy. Eventually, Scott and Cameron decide not to join due to their busy schedules. The group coordinates on potential tee times, with Eldon checking availability. There is also some off-topic mention of mailing items and a check being received.  \n",
       "2  The email thread centers around the drafting and review of the 'long form confirm/MDEA' and related ILA documents. Kay Mann initiates internal distribution for feedback and notes pending formatting and content issues, recommending that recipients recognize the drafts as works in progress. Edward Sacks provides comments, particularly questioning whether a financial support covenant or an 'agent for' structure is stronger, and raises invoicing procedure points. Reagan Rorschach forwards documents to a wider internal group, soliciting comments for Kay. Reagan also asks Kay if raised issues have been incorporated into the ILA and whether they are material, to which Kay responds that the issues have not been incorporated and are not material to the ILA. There is ongoing discussion about addressing legal and structural questions, with several parties, including those dealing with Mississippi law, needing to weigh in.  \n",

Stephanie Panus regularly circulates updated versions of the log and the associated daily termination lists to a wide internal distribution list. Updates include status changes on specific terminations, such as valid terminations for several counterparties and the identification of prepetition mutual terminations. Kim Theriot requests changes to the distribution list to remove herself and Melissa Murphy, and to add additional team members. Later in the thread, Ed McMichael Jr. asks colleagues to investigate a specific termination (CNG LDC/Hope Gas) and a $66 million settlement offer identified in the logs.  \n",

Joe responds apologizing for the delay, explaining he's been busy and unable to make contact about the trailer. The conversation also features casual banter among the group, referencing shared acquaintances and joking about finances. Ben shares news about his personal life, upcoming NYC Marathon plans, travels, and potential job offers, expressing interest in staying connected.  "
